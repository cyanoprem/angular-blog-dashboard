SQL Database
- Table based database

NoSQL Database (Ex: Cloud FireStore)
- Document based database

What is a Document?

It's a group of key-value pairs.

- Group of documents is a collection.
- Group of user documents is a users collection.
- Don't have to structure the documents.

Different type of values that can be stored in FireStore:
1. String
2. Numbers
3. Boolean
4. Map Coordinates
5. Arrays
6. Timestamps
7. Geo point 
8. References
9. Null

How do we add relations in FireStore?
- In SQL the foreign key connects the data between 2 tables.

In noSQL
- Every document has an unique ID in a collection. 
- In another document collection we can import the first collection IDs to connect them.

**But in FireStore we can add Collections inside a document.**
